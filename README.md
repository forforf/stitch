*We interupt this README to update you on changes this fork has from the original project*:  This fork updates stitch so that it can also bundle
in libraries exposed via content distribution networks (or really just any http request). To add in an cdn library as a module, update the config file passed into stich as such:

    config.urlpaths = ['http://path/to/lib/lib.js', ... ]

If you just want to add a cdn library as a dependency, just add it to the 
dependency list

    config.dependencies ['path/to/local/dep/lib.js', 'http://path/to/cdn/dep/lib.js']


Stitch on the server side should be invoked asynchronously. Like so

    app = express.createServer()
    package = stitch.createPackage config, (err, package) ->
      src = package.compile (err, source) ->
        app.get '/app.js', package.createServer()


Modules are cached locally to stitch, dependencies are not.

Usage in browser javascript

    myLib = require('cache-dir/host.com/path/to/lib/myLib')

This is still highly experimental.
Known Issues
- Local cache of remote libraries can only be removed manually (just delete the directory)
- Usage 


Now back to your originally scheduled README ....

Develop and test your JavaScript applications as CommonJS modules in
Node.js. Then __Stitch__ them together to run in the browser.

    npm install stitch

Bundle code in lib/ and vendor/ and serve it with [Express](http://expressjs.com/):

    var stitch  = require('stitch');
    var express = require('express');

    var package = stitch.createPackage({
      paths: [__dirname + '/lib', __dirname + '/vendor']
    });

    var app = express.createServer();
    app.get('/application.js', package.createServer());
    app.listen(3000);

Or build it to a file:

    var stitch  = require('stitch');
    var fs      = require('fs');

    var package = stitch.createPackage({
      paths: [__dirname + '/lib', __dirname + '/vendor']
    });

    package.compile(function (err, source){
      fs.writeFile('package.js', source, function (err) {
        if (err) throw err;
        console.log('Compiled package.js');
      })
    })
